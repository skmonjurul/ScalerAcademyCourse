###Problem Description
```
You are given a constant array A.

You are required to return another array which is the reversed form of the input array.
```



###Problem Constraints
```
1 <= A.size() <= 10000

1 <= A[i] <= 10000
```


###Input Format
```
First argument is a constant array A.
```

###Output Format
```
Return an integer array.
```



###Example Input
####Input 1:

```
A = [1,2,3,2,1]
```
####Input 2:

```
A = [1,1,10]
```


###Example Output

```
[1,2,3,2,1]
```
####Output 2:

```
[10,1,1]
```


###Example Explanation
