###Problem Description
You have 20 blue balls and 14 red balls in a bag. You put your hand in and remove 2 at a time.
```
If they’re of the same color, you add a blue ball to the bag.
If they’re of different colors, you add a red ball to the bag.
```

( Assume you have a big supply of blue & red balls for this purpose).

```

```
