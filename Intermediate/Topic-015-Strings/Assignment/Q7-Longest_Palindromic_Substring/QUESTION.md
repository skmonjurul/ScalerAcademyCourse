###Problem Description
```
Given a string A of size N, find and return the longest palindromic substring in A.

Substring of string A is A[i...j] where 0 <= i <= j < len(A)

Palindrome string:
A string which reads the same backwards. More formally, A is palindrome if reverse(A) = A.

Incase of conflict, return the substring which occurs first ( with the least starting index).
```


###Problem Constraints
```
1 <= N <= 6000
```

###Input Format
```
First and only argument is a string A.
```

###Output Format
```
Return a string denoting the longest palindromic substring of string A.
```

###Example Input
```
A = "aaaabaaa"
```

###Example Output
```
"aaabaaa"
```


###Example Explanation
```
We can see that longest palindromic substring is of length 7 and the string is "aaabaaa".
```
