###Problem Description
```
You are given the root node of a binary tree A. You have to find the number of nodes in this tree.
```


###Problem Constraints
```
1 <= Number of nodes in the tree <= 10^5

0 <= Value of each node <= 10^7
```


###Input Format
```
The first and only argument is a tree node A.
```


###Output Format
```
Return an integer denoting the number of nodes of the tree.
```


###Example Input
####Input 1:

```
Values =  1
         / \     
        4   3                        
```
####Input 2:
