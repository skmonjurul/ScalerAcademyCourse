###Problem Description
```
Given a singly linked list A, determine if it's a palindrome. Return 1 or 0, denoting if it's a palindrome or not, respectively.
```


###Problem Constraints
```
1 <= |A| <= 10^5
```



###Input Format
```
The first and the only argument of input contains a pointer to the head of the given linked list.
```


###Output Format
```
Return 0, if the linked list is not a palindrome.

Return 1, if the linked list is a palindrome.
```


###Example Input
####Input 1:

```
A = [1, 2, 2, 1]
```
####Input 2:

```
A = [1, 3, 2]
```


###Example Output
####Output 1:

```
1
```
####Output 2:

```
0
```


###Example Explanation
####Explanation 1:

```
The first linked list is a palindrome as [1, 2, 2, 1] is equal to its reversed form.
```
####Explanation 2:

```
The second linked list is not a palindrom as [1, 3, 2] is not equal to [2, 3, 1].
