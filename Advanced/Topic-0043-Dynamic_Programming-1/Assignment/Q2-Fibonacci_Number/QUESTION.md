###Problem Description
```
Given a positive integer A, write a program to find the Ath Fibonacci number.

In a Fibonacci series, each term is the sum of the previous two terms and the first two terms of the series are 0 and 1. i.e. f(0) = 0 and f(1) = 1. Hence, f(2) = 1, f(3) = 2, f(4) = 3 and so on.

NOTE: 0th term is 0. 1th term is 1 and so on.
```


###Problem Constraints
```
0 <= A <= 44
```


###Input Format
```
First and only argument is an integer A.
```


###Output Format
```
Return an integer denoting the Ath Fibonacci number.
```


###Example Input
####Input 1:

```
A = 4
```
####Input 2:

```
A = 6
```


###Example Output
####Output 1:

```
3
```
####Output 2:

```
8
```


###Example Explanation
####Explanation 1:

```
Terms of Fibonacci series are: 0, 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21 and so on.
0th term is 0 So, 4th term of Fibonacci series is 3.
```
####Explanation 2:

```
6th term of Fibonacci series is 8.
