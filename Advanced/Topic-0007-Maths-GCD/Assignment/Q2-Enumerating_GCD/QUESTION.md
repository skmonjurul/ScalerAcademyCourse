###Problem Description
```
You are given a number A and a number B. Greatest Common Divisor (GCD) of all numbers between A and B inclusive is taken (GCD(A, A+1, A+2 ... B)).
As this problem looks a bit easy, it is given that numbers A and B can be in the range of 10100.

You have to return the value of GCD found.

The greatest common divisor of 2 numbers, A and B, is the largest number, D that divides both A and B perfectly.
```


###Problem Constraints
```
1 <= A <= B <= 10^100
```



###Input Format
```
First argument is a string denoting A.

Second argument is a string denoting B.
```


###Output Format
```
Return a string which contains the digits of the integer which represents the GCD. The returned string should not have any leading zeroes.
```


###Example Input
```
A = "1"
B = "3"
```

###Example Output
```
1
```


###Example Explanation
```
Greatest divisor that divides both 1 and 3 is 1.
