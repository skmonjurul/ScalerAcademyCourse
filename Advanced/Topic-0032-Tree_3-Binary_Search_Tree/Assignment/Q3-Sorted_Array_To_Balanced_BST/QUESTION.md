###Problem Description
```
Given an array where elements are sorted in ascending order, convert it to a height Balanced Binary Search Tree (BBST).

Balanced tree : a height-balanced binary tree is defined as a binary tree in which the depth of the two subtrees of every node never differ by more than 1.
```


###Problem Constraints
```
1 <= length of array <= 100000
```


###Input Format
```
First argument is an integer array A.
```


###Output Format
```
Return a root node of the Binary Search Tree.
```


###Example Input
####Input 1:

```
A : [1, 2, 3]
```
####Input 2:

```
A : [1, 2, 3, 5, 10]
```

###Example Output
####Output 1:
```
      2
    /   \
   1     3
```
Output 2:
```
      3
    /   \
   2     5
  /       \
 1         10

```
###Example Explanation
####Explanation 1:

```
You need to return the root node of the Binary Tree.
```
