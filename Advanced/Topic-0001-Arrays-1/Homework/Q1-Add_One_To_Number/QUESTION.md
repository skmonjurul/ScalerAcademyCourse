###Problem Description
```
Given a non-negative number represented as an array of digits, add 1 to the number ( increment the number represented by the digits ).

The digits are stored such that the most significant digit is at the head of the list.

NOTE: Certain things are intentionally left unclear in this question which you should practice asking the interviewer. For example: for this problem, the following are some good questions to ask :

Q: Can the input have 0's before the most significant digit. Or, in other words, is 0 1 2 3 a valid input?
A: For the purpose of this question, YES
Q: Can the output have 0's before the most significant digit? Or, in other words, is 0 1 2 4 a valid output?
A: For the purpose of this question, NO. Even if the input has zeroes before the most significant digit.
```

###Problem Constraints
