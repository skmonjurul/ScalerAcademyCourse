###Problem Description
```
Given a linked list of integers, find and return the middle element of the linked list.

NOTE: If there are N nodes in the linked list and N is even then return the (N/2 + 1)th element.
```


###Problem Constraints
```
1 <= length of the linked list <= 100000

1 <= Node value <= 10^9
```


###Input Format
```
The only argument given head pointer of linked list.
```


###Output Format
```
Return the middle element of the linked list.
```



###Example Input
####Input 1:

```
1 -> 2 -> 3 -> 4 -> 5
```
####Input 2:

```
1 -> 5 -> 6 -> 2 -> 3 -> 4
```


###Example Output
####Output 1:

```
3
```
####Output 2:

```
2
```


###Example Explanation
####Explanation 1:

```
The middle element is 3.
```
####Explanation 2:

```
The middle element in even length linked list of length N is ((N/2) + 1)th element which is 2.
