###Problem Description
```
Given the number of vertices A in a Cyclic Graph.

Your task is to determine the minimum number of colors required to color the graph so that no two Adjacent vertices have the same color.


A cyclic graph with A vertices is a graph with A edges, such that it forms a loop. See example test case explanation for more details.

###Problem Constraints
```
3 <= A <= 10^9
```



###Input Format
```
First argument is an integer A denoting the number of vertices in the Cyclic Graph.
```


###Output Format
```
Return an single integer denoting the minimum number of colors required to color the graph so that no two Adjacent vertices have the same color.
```
