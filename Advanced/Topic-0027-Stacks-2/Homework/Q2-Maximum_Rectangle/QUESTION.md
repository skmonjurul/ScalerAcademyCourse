###Problem Description
```
Given a 2D binary matrix of integers A containing 0's and 1's of size N x M.

Find the largest rectangle containing only 1's and return its area.

Note: Rows are numbered from top to bottom and columns are numbered from left to right.
```

###Input Format

```
The only argument given is the integer matrix A.
```
###Output Format

```
Return the area of the largest rectangle containing only 1's.
```
###Constraints

```
1 <= N, M <= 1000
0 <= A[i] <= 1
```
###For Example

```
Input 1:
A = [   [0, 0, 1]
        [0, 1, 1]
        [1, 1, 1]   ]
Output 1:
