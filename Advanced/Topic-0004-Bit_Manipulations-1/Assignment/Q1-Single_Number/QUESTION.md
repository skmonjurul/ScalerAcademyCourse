###Problem Description
```
Given an array of integers A, every element appears twice except for one. Find that integer that occurs once.

NOTE: Your algorithm should have a linear runtime complexity. Could you implement it without using extra memory?
```


###Problem Constraints
```
2 <= |A| <= 2000000

0 <= A[i] <= INTMAX
```


###Input Format
```
The first and only argument of input contains an integer array A.
```



###Output Format
```
Return a single integer denoting the single element.
```



###Example Input
####Input 1:

```
A = [1, 2, 2, 3, 1]
```
####Input 2:

```
A = [1, 2, 2]
```



###Example Output

```
3
```
####Output 2:

```
1
```


###Example Explanation
####Explanation 1:

```
