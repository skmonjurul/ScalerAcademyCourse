###Problem Description
```
Given an array of integers, every element appears thrice except for one, which occurs once.

Find that element that does not appear thrice.

NOTE: Your algorithm should have a linear runtime complexity.

Could you implement it without using extra memory?
```



###Problem Constraints
```
2 <= A <= 5*10^6

0 <= A <= INTMAX
```


###Input Format
```
First and only argument of input contains an integer array A.
```



###Output Format
```
Return a single integer.
```



###Example Input
####Input 1:

```
A = [1, 2, 4, 3, 3, 2, 2, 3, 1, 1]
```
####Input 2:

```
A = [0, 0, 0, 1]
```


###Example Output
####Output 1:

```
4
```
####Output 2:

```
1
```


###Example Explanation
